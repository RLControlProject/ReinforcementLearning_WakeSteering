!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify

!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!
The new method for computing all the high-box cases is not producing the same set of cases as the old algorithm.
This should only happen if you have complex sweeps that you modified manually after the code creates the initial arrays
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases_old to see the cases using the old algorithm
Check the variable <obj>.allHighBoxCases     to see the cases using the new algorithm
You should check which xr.dataset has the correct, unique inflow_deg values. The correct array will only have unique values

    The new method appears to be correct here! Trust but verify
